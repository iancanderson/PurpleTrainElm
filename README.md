# Purple Train

Purple Train is a mobile app that provides schedules, predictions, and alerts
for [MBTA Commuter Rail] riders.

The app is written in the [elm] language, using the experimental [elm-native-ui]
library. See the [Elm Native UI in Production] blog post about why we are
excited about writing mobile apps in elm.

## Setup

* Make sure you have [elm v0.18](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html)
  installed
* Run `bin/setup`

## Development

Run `yarn run watch`

This will start a watch server, which will recompile the elm files when they are
saved.

We recommend using [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format) with your
editor. You can set it up to format your Elm files when automatically saving
them.

## Running the app

Run `yarn run start` to start the react native packager, which will serve the
javascript bundle to your mobile devices and simulators.

### iOS

Open `ios/PurpleTrain.xcodeproj` and run the project to launch an iPhone
simulator.

### Android

Follow the [React Native Getting Started guide] to create and run a virtual
Android device.
